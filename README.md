# C# Windows Compiler

This programm has maded in C and i used DevCPP to compile the code,this programm has made for compilation in C#(the windows have C# compiler but this file has maded for shortcut purposes), probably your windows will warn that file is malicious but isnt(the windows just warn because the programm isnt compiled in your computer).

# How 2 Use?

```console
csc.exe 
```

## If you have some question about the real purpose of this .exe use dnSpy to show the function of itself
